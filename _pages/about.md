## 🍀About me 

Come from **Taiyuan, Shanxi, China**, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at **ShenYang Jianzhu University**. In the future, I plan to live and work in Hangzhou, Nanjing, or Shanghai. 

I have participated in many **ACM algorithm** competitions but have now retired. In my daily life, I enjoy reading and photography. If you have the same interests, please feel free to communicate with me.

## 🏆Speedrun

-----------

I have participated in many speedrun competitions, mainly working on the **Hollow Knight** IL project, and have achieved top 30 worldwide rankings in each of them, even winning a **WR** in one of them and a **fourth** place in another.
